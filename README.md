## CodeFellowship

### Contributors Joshua McCluskey

### Overview
Build an app that allows users to log into CodeFellowship.

- The site should have a login page.
- The login page should have a link to a signup page.
- An ApplicationUser should have a username, password (will be hashed using BCrypt), firstName, lastName, dateOfBirth, bio, and any other fields you think are useful.
- All of these fields must be set at signup. They will not be editable at any other time.
- The site should allow users to create an ApplicationUser on the “sign up” page.
- Your Controller should have an @Autowired private PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder; and use that to run passwordEncoder.encode(password) before saving the password into the new user.
- Using the cheat sheet above in “Resources”, add the ability for users to log in to your app.
- The site should have a homepage at the root route (/) that contains basic information about the site.
- This page should have links to login and signup if the user is NOT logged in.
- This page should have a link to logout if the user IS logged in.
- Ensure that users can log out and are redirected to the home page or login page.
- When a user is logged in, the app should display the user’s username on every page (probably in the heading).
- Ensure that your homepage, login, and registration routes are accessible to non-logged in users.
- The site should be well-styled and attractive.
- The site should use templates to display its information.
- Ensure that user registration also logs users into your app automatically.

## CodeFellowship Day 2 Authorization

### Contributors Joshua McCluskey

### Overview
- Build an app that allows users to log into CodeFellowship.

- Upon logging in, users should be taken to a /myprofile route that displays their information.
- This should include a default profile picture, which is the same for every user, and their basic information from ApplicationUser.
- The site should have a page which allows viewing the data about a single ApplicationUser, at a route like /users/{id}.
- This should include a default profile picture, which is the same for every user, and their basic information.
- Continue to ensure that your homepage, login, and registration routes are accessible to non-logged in users. All other routes should be limited to logged-in users.
- Add a Post entity to your app.
- A Post has a body and a createdAt timestamp.
- A logged-in user should be able to create a Post, and a post should belong to the user that created it.
- Hint: This is a relationship between two pieces of data
- A user’s posts should be visible on their profile page.
- The site should use reusable templates for its information. (At a minimum, it should have one Thymeleaf fragment that is used on multiple pages.)
- The site should have a non-whitelabel error handling page that lets the user know, at minimum, the error code and a brief message about what went wrong.

### Stretch Goals

- A logged-in user should be able to edit their profile. (Double stretch: allow them to change their passwords if they enter their current password.)
- An “admin” user should be able to edit anyone’s profile.
